# Tic-Tac-Toe
In this game, as we run the program the user will first get some guidelines for 
the same, then it asks the user to if he wants to play with the computer or with 
his friend. The program then asks for the name of the player/players and asks 
each player to enter a character of his own choice. Then finally the game begins;
the program asks the first player to enter the index at which he wants to place 
his character, after his turn the second player is asked the same question, and 
this continues.
However, it is made sure that an index which is already been occupied is not 
changed and secondly that an unknown index is not entered. In any of the abovementioned cases the player is informed about his mistake and is asked for 
another valid index.
A player wins the game when the character he has chosen appear in either 
single row, column or diagonal of the matrix
At the end the program informs the user whether any of the two players won 
the game or it is a tie.
